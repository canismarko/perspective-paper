Dear Reviewers,

Thank you for your time in reviewing our paper and supplying feedback. We would like to address your comments:

Reviewer 1: 
1. The introduction of instrumentation occupies more than half length of the text, and should be greatly shortened

We believe that it is useful to provide the reader with some background information on how an x-ray experiment is carried out. Understanding key pieces, such as how x-rays are generated and treated, general modes of microscopy, and detectors, will allow the reader, who may be interested in performing chemcial x-ray imaging techniques of their own, to evaluate the proper tools they may use. That being said, many of the details that we included in the original manuscript may be extraneous information that is unnecessary when communicating chemical x-ray imaging techniques. You will find that we have removed some of the more specific information regarding instrumentation, only providing what we believe to be essential for the reader to possess.

2. The examples of applications should be better categorized. For example, they can be divided into anode and cathode (or full cell â€¦), or categorized based on the nature of the probed problems according to the three parameters described by the authors.

Reviewer 2:
1. This appears to be a review paper with only 65 references. Given the amount of recent work in this area, then the paper would be improved if more literature should be considered.

This paper is meant to be a perspective, not a review, and is thus not meant to be an exhaustive probe into the field. We've included a wide range of techniques and representative examples of each in the literature.

2. There is no mention of tomography applied to Zn based batteries such as Zn-Air and Zn-Ni.



3. There is little discussion of in-operando radiography. In particular there is no mention of the paper by Shearing et al on the direct radiography imaging of batteries undergoing extreme failure in Nature Comm.
