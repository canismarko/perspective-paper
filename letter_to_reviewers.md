Dear Reviewers,

Thank you for your time in reviewing our paper and supplying
feedback. Many of the changes we have made involve re-arrangement of
whole sections with minimal re-writing of the content to creat smooth
transitions. Additionally, we have briefly addressed the "missing"
papers identified by the reviewers; we do not see a need for inclusion
of more figures. Lastly, we have made minor changes for clarity and
fixed a few typographical errors.

We would like to address your specific comments below.

## Reviewer 1

We believe that it is useful to provide the reader with some
background information on how an x-ray experiment is carried
out. Understanding key pieces, such as how x-rays are generated and
treated, general modes of microscopy, and detectors, will allow
readers, who may be interested in performing chemcial x-ray imaging
techniques of their own, to evaluate the proper tools they may
use. That being said, many of the details that we included in the
original manuscript are superfluous when communicating chemical x-ray
imaging techniques. We have removed much of the specific information
regarding instrumentation, with the aim of providing only information
relevant to X-ray imaging.

We have re-evaluated the organization of the applications section. The
examples are now grouped by the type of insight provided by the
technique: morphology vs oxidation vs structure. Within each section,
the text starts with 2D and/or ex situ examples, then moves on to
three-dimensional and/or operando measurements (depending on the
section). We feel this schema best highlights the range of techniques
that have been demonstrated and best matches the natural structure
within the literature.

## Reviewer 2:

This paper is meant to be a perspective, not a review, and is thus not
meant to be an exhaustive probe into the field. We've included a wide
range of techniques and representative examples of each in the
literature.

Our goal in the applications section is to compare and contrast the
ways that X-ray imaging can provide insight into the mechanisms
underlying battery reactions. Given the broad range of materials that
are currently being studied, there are many examples of specific
materials that we did not cover. The work done on Zn-air or Zn-Ni is
certainly relevant, however the insights are similar to other
applications already provided and so we did not find it valuable to
cover these materials in detail. We have clarified this in the
beginning of the applications section.

We discuss several examples of morphological imaging ("radiography")
in the morphology section, though it is true these do not focus on
operando measurements. We originally did not include the Shearing et
al. paper because it does not provide insight into the chemical
mechanism; rather it describes the mechanical failure of a specific
cell construction. Upon further reflection, the very high
time-resolution in this paper does provide a nice example of one
extreme of the resolution triangle. As such, we have mentioned it
briefly at the beginning of the "Morphology" applications section.
