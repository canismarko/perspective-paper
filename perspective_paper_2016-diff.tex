\begin{abstract}
  Unlocking the full performance capabilities of battery materials
  will require a thorough understanding of the underlying
  electrochemical mechanisms at a variety of length scales. A broad
  arsenal of X-ray microscopy and mapping techniques is now available
  to probe these processes down to the nano-scale. The tunable nature
  of X-ray sources allows for the extraction of chemical states
  through spectromicroscopy. The addition of phase contrast imaging
  can retrieve the complex-valued refraction of the material, giving
  an even more nuanced chemical picture. Tomography and coherent Bragg
  diffraction imaging provide a reconstructed three-dimensional volume
  of the specimen, as well as internal strain information from the
  latter. Many recent insights into battery materials have been
  achieved through the creative use of these, and similar,
  methods. Experiments performed while the battery is being actively
  cycled reveal behavior that differs significantly from what is
  observed at equilibrium and meta-stable conditions. Planned
  improvements to X-ray source brightness and coherence will extend
  these techniques by alleviating the current trade-off in time,
  chemical and spatial resolution.

\section{Introduction}

Beyond the visible consumer electronics applications, energy storage
plays a critical role in areas such as manufacturing, transportation
and electricity generation. By some estimates, US industries lose \$80
billion each year due to power interruptions, while annual electric
vehicle sales are seeing large and consistent
increases\cite{whittingham2012}. Additionally, if renewables are to
become the main source of energy production, we will need storage
solutions to deal with their intermittent nature. Even with coal and
natural gas, fluctuations in demand require that more expensive
``peaker plants'' be brought online, which could be alleviated if
energy from base-load plants can be stored when demand is low. The
cheapest energy storage methods, pumped-hydro and compressed-air, are
severely limited by the availability of suitable locations. Currently,
batteries hold much promise as portable energy storage
systems. Batteries contain two electrodes, sites where oxidation and
reduction reactions (redox) take place\cite{armand2008}. The
fundamental redox chemistry within batteries is non-trivial and
governs the practical aspects that are felt by the consumer, such as
capacity, cycle life, and power, among others. Therefore, advances in
battery technology that yield cheaper, more reliable and better
performing systems will result in large economic, environmental and
geopolitical benefits. A key requirement for achieving this goal is a
better understanding of the chemistry underlying these materials, in
order to operate as close as possible to their theoretical limits.

Measuring chemical properties with spatial resolution provides a view
of the underlying mechanisms that is not available by looking at bulk
properties. Electrodes generally adopt a hierarchical structure
wherein single crystallites of a redox-active material combine to form
agglomerate particles, which are then combined with conductive
additives and flexible polymeric binders into a thick (ideally, above
\SI{100}{\micro\metre}), porous electrode architecture (figure
\ref{figure:multiscale-1}) where different distributions of components
and particle sizes are likely to exist throughout the electrode,
demonstrated in figure \ref{figure:multiscale-2}. In addition, the
thickness of the electrode introduces asymmetries in the transport of
ions (from the electrolyte) and electrons (from the current collector,
figure \ref{figure:multiscale-2}), which are both required in order
for the redox reaction to proceed. As a result, a hierarchy of
inhomogeneities develops during the phase transformation, both within
the electrode\cite{newman1995,srinivasan2014} and within individual
particles. These inhomogeneities are kinetic in origin, beyond the
changes that would be inherent to the phase transformation within a
particle, and, thus, prone to vary with the currents to which the
battery is subjected. Probing all of these length-scales provides
clues for helping meet the high demands placed on current technology.

X-rays are able to probe various length scales using a variety of
contrast mechanisms. Compared to electron microscopy, another common
tool for achieving spatially resolved information from cathode
materials, X-rays are significantly less damaging to the material
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in
most conditions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{under most circumstances}\DIFaddend . Additionally, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) in particular has stringent requirements for sample
thickness, often below \SI{100}{nm}. In contrast, the ability to tune
the X-ray energies offers flexibility in terms of the ability to
measure large objects. This Perspective focuses on the use of X-ray
techniques as a means to collect chemical information over various
time and length scales. It is biased toward techniques that have
already seen applicability in battery science. In other words, it is
not meant to be an exhaustive review of all X-ray imaging and mapping
techniques that may be available. Readers interested in such reviews
are referred to several papers in the peer-reviewed
literature\cite{rose2013, maire2014, monteiro2013, kawahara2015}.

\section{Foreword: Definition of Resolution}

Before exploring in detail the different techniques of interest, it is
important to define a framework which guides the design of any imaging
experiment. This framework is based on the fact that the objective of
any chemical imaging experiment is to achieve the maximum resolution
along three parameters: space, chemistry and time (as illustrated in
figure \ref{figure:resolution-triangle}). Because advances in spatial
resolution are desirable in order to achieve the ultimate objective of
visualizing atomic structures, this parameter tends to be the focus of
the attention of researchers developing these techniques. However, as
will become apparent throughout this perspective, the deepest level of
insight into the electrochemical reactions that determine battery
function requires a thorough detection of different chemical states
that may often present similar signals, all while operating under an
electrochemical stimulus. The latter necessarily implies the
importance of temporal resolution so as to acquire multiple data
points along the reaction pathway, which may be as fast as
seconds. Advances are still needed that push the three parameters
forward at the same time. Instead, the current situation forces
sacrifices in either of these scales of resolution.

\section{The X-ray Imaging Experiment}

\subsection{X-ray Sources}

X-ray generation is possible by two different means: laboratory
sources and synchrotron facilities. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Laboratory sources are relatively
compact and cheap, both in capital and operation costs. }\DIFdelend The general
concept of the lab source is based on tubes under vacuum, containing a
cathode that is biased so as to generate and accelerate
electrons. These electrons collide with the metallic anode, generating
X-rays over a narrow range of wavelengths. The specific wavelengths of
the resultant X-rays are dependent on the metal used for the
anode. Common laboratory X-ray sources include the sealed X-ray tube
and rotating anode generator, which differ on the level of vacuum,
seal and the arrangement of the metallic anode\cite{guinebretiere}.

Synchrotron radiation is also generated from accelerating charged
particles, but provides higher intensity and better coherence than is
currently possible with laboratory sources. Unlike laboratory sources,
which are broadly available, synchrotrons require very large areal
footprints and, thus, are part of central facilities that are open to
users worldwide through a competitive proposal system. The particles,
typically electrons, are first accelerated to relativistic speeds, at
which point they enter the storage ring of the synchrotron. Beamlines
are built tangential to the storage ring so as to utilize X-ray
radiation generated when the particles are subjected to centripetal
acceleration, either through bending magnets or insertion devices,
such as wigglers and undulators. Bending magnets serve two
purposes. First, they are placed in such a way that the charged
particles in the storage ring are redirected to maintain a proper
pathway. Second, each redirection generates X-rays, which are then
used in experimental stations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This ``parasitic'' radiation was
considered merely an inconvenient loss of energy in conventional
particle accelerators, but has since been harnessed for great benefit
in a variety of scientific disciplines. }\DIFdelend Insertion devices are specialized for
generating X-rays and differ from bending magnets in that they are
straight sections of the ring that have alternating magnetic
fields. Charged particles oscillate through the device, with each
oscillation essentially equivalent to a single bending
magnet. Therefore, the generated photons can reach higher energies
than those generated by bending magnets\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The major difference between
wigglers and undulators is that the latter have a smaller amplitude
per oscillation than the former, which results in a narrower bandwidth
of photons produced. An emerging technology, the free electron laser
(FEL), utilizes a beam of ordered electrons. In this way, radiation
waves are generated that can be superimposed, resulting in larger
amplitudes. This results in a narrower beam, higher brightness, and
shorter pulse times than in synchrotron
rings}\DIFdelend \cite{synchrotronradiation}.

An important distinction between laboratory X-ray sources and
synchrotron sources is the nature of the X-rays produced. Synchrotron
light sources can generate X-rays at much higher intensity than
laboratory sources\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which can be described in terms of flux and
brightness. Flux is representative of the number of X-ray photons that
pass a plane per unit time, typically given in photons/second. The
definition for brightness varies from author to author, however, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines it as
``the radiated power per unit solid angle per unit area normal to the
}%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{vector}%DIFDELCMD < ] %%%
\DIFdel{direction''\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{sesame2004}}%DIFAUXCMD
. To put it simply, brightness is
analogous to the flux, while taking into account the source size and
divergence. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend Another major difference between laboratory
sources and synchrotron sources is that the optics within a
synchrotron create a tunable polychromatic X-ray beam, which can
subsequently be set to a narrow energy range through the use of
monochromators upstream from the end station. In contrast, laboratory
sources only produce a limited range of X-ray energies, which is
non-trivial to tune. While some techniques fully utilize the white
beam\cite{ice2009}, it is more common to select a single desired
wavelength and change it during the experiment. Different energy
regimes are defined in the X-ray community. Typically, X-rays with
energies below $\sim$\SI{2000}{eV} are termed ``soft'', whereas
beamlines operating in the ``hard'' X-ray regime achieve values above
$\sim$\SI{4000}{eV}. The intermediate regime between ``soft'' and
``hard'' is often termed ``tender''. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Historically, beamlines operating at this regime were less
common than hard and soft counterparts, but there is renewed interest
in techniques that require these intermediate energy values. The high flux}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The high intensity}\DIFaddend , brightness
and tunability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{renders }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{render }\DIFaddend synchrotrons as the preferred light sources for
chemical imaging.

\subsection{Methods of X-ray Microscopy}

There are two general modes of X-ray microscopy: full-field and
scanning (as illustrated in figure \ref{figure:maser2005}). The
operation of a full-field X-ray microscope is similar to a
conventional visible light microscope. In a full-field microscope, the
X-ray beam is first focused down to a few microns. This microbeam
illuminates the sample, generating a large \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{frame }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{field }\DIFaddend of view. The
resulting photons are magnified by a second set of optics before
reaching the detector.  In this mode, the limit in spatial resolution
is set by the detector pixel size and any aberrations in the
optics. This method results in large images with fine resolution in a
single shot. In contrast, a scanning microscope is based on focusing
the beam prior to illuminating the sample.  In order to collect frames
of view that are larger than the illuminated spot, the beam is
subsequently rastered over the region of interest in the sample. In
this case, the spatial resolution is determined by the combination of
beam and scanning step size. Given the different methods of operation,
it can easily be concluded that full-field imaging offers higher image
throughput than scanning imaging at the highest possible setting. On
the other hand, scanning techniques allow for higher versatility in
contrast mechanisms than in full field mode, especially when
combinations are desired.

\begin{figure}

    scanning probe and (b) full-field imaging synchrotron hard X-ray

    Photon Source. \textit{Microscopy and Microanalysis}

    University Press.}
  \label{figure:maser2005}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tomography}

Individual images in both full-field and scanning X-ray microscopes
are generated in two spatial dimensions. However, the two techniques
offer the capability of 3D imaging using tomography. A tomographic
reconstruction is achieved by taking a series of two-dimensional
projection images while the sample is rotated over \ang{180}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(ideally)}\DIFaddend , followed by conversion of these images to a
three-dimensional volume. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{process is also known as an inverse Radon transform. This }\DIFdelend technique is agnostic regarding the
contrast mechanism by which the two-dimensional projections were
created, meaning it can be combined with any X-ray microscopy contrast
mechanism discussed here. Provided the methodology involves the
measurement of transmitted photons, tomography allows for the effects
of sample thickness to be removed so that the intensity of each voxel
is dependent only on material composition. Since the sample is
rotating, precise alignment of the rotation axis is necessary to keep
the sample in view.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{There are many algorithms available for
performing the reconstruction: each seeks a balance between speed and
accuracy. They generally fall into two categories: analytical and
iterative. Analytical techniques are usually a variant of
back-projection and vary by the exact nature of the filters applied to
the input data. They have the advantage of being very fast, but often
introduce artifacts. Iterative techniques introduce fewer artifacts
that also tend to be uncorrelated, but reconstruction often requires
many iterations to achieve reliable results, which makes this approach
considerably slower than the analytical algorithms. New methods are
being developed that combine the advantages of both techniques. For
example, if many samples with similar properties are to be analyzed, a
set of optimized filters for back-projection can be derived via
machine learning. The initial training is quite slow but once
complete, the filters can be used with any new dataset provided that
the sample responds similarly to the training
data\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pelt2013}}%DIFAUXCMD
. However, this requirement is stricter than it
seems at first sight: many of the desired insights about an
electrochemical reaction depend on the precise measurement of changes
in the interactions between material and X-rays during the
experiment. A major advantage of this approach, though, is that the
training can be performed in such a way that it expects low quality
datasets, such as those with few projections, so subsequent
experiments have increased temporal resolution.
}\DIFdelend 

\subsection{X-ray Optics}

All the techniques discussed here require at least some level of
focusing of the X-ray beam prior to, and, in some cases, also after,
interaction with the sample. The ability to obtain images at
increasing spatial resolution is dependent on the type, sophistication
and quality of the focusing optics.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Refractive lenses, common to visible light microscopy, are less useful
for focusing X-rays, due to the small amounts of refraction that
result from them. A single refractive lens capable of achieving proper
focus would be valuable but unreasonably large. }\DIFdelend Compound refractive lenses (CRL) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, however, }\DIFdelend use several lenses in series to focus
an X-ray beam. CRLs are made of low atomic number materials to reduce
X-ray absorption\cite{lengeler1996}. Reflective optics are used as
well for X-ray focusing. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{First proposed by Kirkpatrick and Baez in
1948, one }\DIFaddend common setup is the use of two grazing incidence reflective
mirrors that are orthogonal to one another \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(KB mirrors)}\DIFaddend . This setup
allows for the incoming X-ray beam to be focused in both
dimensions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{First proposed by Kirkpatrick and Baez in
1948, the system is known as Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors. }\DIFdelend Both CRLs and KB mirrors are typically used for hard
X-rays\cite{kirkpatrick1948}.

Diffractive optics are an alternative option. They are predominant in
the soft X-ray regime, but are also compatible with hard X-ray
radiation. Fresnel Zone Plates (FZP) utilize several concentric rings
of alternating opaque and transparent zones\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, decreasing in width as a
function of distance from the center}\DIFaddend . In this way, the diffracted
X-rays from the transparent sections of the optic will undergo
constructive interference, focusing to a point. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Zones that are
farther from the center of the optic have shorter widths. }\DIFdelend The maximum amount
that the beam can be focused is inversely related to the width \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend of the
outermost \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{zone}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ring}\DIFaddend .  Multi-layer Laue Lenses (MLL) are similar to FZPs, in
that they use zones to achieve focusing. However, MLLs use
one-dimensional zones rather than rings. Because of this, they can be
synthesized using thin film deposition, which allows for smaller
thicknesses than current lithographic
techniques\cite{synchrotronradiation,lblzoneplate}.

Modern focusing optics typically limit the spatial resolution of the
measurement to roughly \SI{10}{nm}, with MLLs\cite{yan2014}. Focusing
optics have an inherent disadvantage that the resultant spatial
resolution is dependent on the optic itself. Lensless techniques
remove this restriction. Coherent diffraction patterns may be
collected and processed using an iterative reconstruction method to
produce an image. Thus, the ultimate limit resides in the wavelength
of the incoming radiation, also known as the diffraction limit,
meaning that spatial resolutions can be achieved that are smaller than
the size of the beam on the sample and the nominal resolution of the
optics. Techniques derived from this approach are further discussed
below.

\subsection{Detectors}

In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{general, X-ray detectors fall into two categories: integrating and
counting. Integrating detectors store up the total number of photons
and are periodically read and cleared by the electronics. In contrast,
counting detectors register and report each individual photon captured
as a separate event. Detectors of the same operating mode share common
properties, even if the underlying mechanisms may vary
significantly. Integrating detectors usually have a limit on how many
photons they can capture before being read, which effectively limits
the dynamic range. Counting detectors do not have this
limitation. However, there is a certain dead-time involved in
converting the photon into a digital signal and any other photons
arriving during this time will not be detected. It is worth noting
that the first detectors were actually two-dimensional analog film,
though they have been superseded by digital detectors, either
charge-coupled device (CCD), multi-wire proportional counters (MWP),
or arrays of point-detectors. CCDs are integrating detectors and, as
such, respond well to high flux/count rates since there is no
dead-time associated with each photon event. A proportional counter
detects each photon as a separate event so there is theoretically no
limit to its dynamic range other than the bit-depth of the downstream
electronics. In an MWP detector, each photon induces an avalanche of
ionization near the detector anode, which is then neutralized when the
charge drifts back towards the cathode. This reset time limits the
local flux that can be measured accurately. Combined with the time
needed for readout of each event, this limits the global flux that can
be measured accurately. Proportional counters are more common on
laboratory instruments, whereas CCDs dominate in synchrotron
experiments.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In }\DIFdelend full-field microscopy, the magnified X-ray image strikes a
scintillator where it is converted to visible light. The total energy
of this conversion must be conserved, so one high-energy X-ray photon
results in hundreds of low-energy visible light photons. This light is
then magnified using visible-light microscopy optics onto a detector,
usually a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CCD}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{charge-coupled device (CCD)}\DIFaddend . Any defects in the scintillator
are clearly visible in the resulting intensity images so it is
important to collect a reference frame to remove these features. For
scanning microscopy, no post-sample optics are required. Instead, a
detector measures the transmitted intensity at each raster
position. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have a large collection area,
low noise and high gain, making them ideal for this application. In
some specific scanning microscopy methods, a two-dimensional
interference pattern is needed at each raster position, so a CCD
detector is used instead.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Detectors specific for the detection of diffracted X-rays can also be
described by their geometry. Point-detectors can capture photons at
only one position at a time and are then scanned across a range of
scattering angles to acquire a one-dimensional diffraction
pattern. They are commonly used in laboratory diffractometers and when
the sample can be assumed to behave as an ideal powder. A major
advantage is that a variety of absorbers and slits can be positioned
to reduce fluorescence and air scattering. Line-detectors can capture
a range of angles simultaneously. They produce the same
one-dimensional pattern, only faster. A disadvantage of both of these
geometries is that they only retrieve a slice through the full
Debye-Scherrer rings. If only a small number of crystallites are
present, it is unlikely that any diffraction conditions will land on
this slice. For diffraction mapping techniques this is often the case,
so these detectors are unsuitable. An area detector, however, captures
a two-dimensional segment of the full pattern and so any diffraction
vectors landing within this segment will be detected. The exact range
depends on the geometry of the experimental setup and the wavelength
of radiation used: high energy X-rays cause more diffraction
conditions to be detectable in a given area. A 1-dimensional
diffraction pattern can then be obtained by integrating across the
Debye-Scherrer rings.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The dynamic range of the detector is an important factor to
consider. CCDs work by exposing a photo-active layer to radiation,
which then results in charge accumulation in the underlying structure,
to be read out after some time interval. If a single CCD pixel becomes
saturated before being read, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{any additional charge from subsequent
photons will bleed into neighboring pixels. In full-field microscopy,
this tends to be a problem in the reference images, since the maximum
intensity is larger: these areas }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the area }\DIFaddend will have artificially low
values in the resulting optical depth image. Shortening exposure time
can solve this problem, however the resulting data will have a lower
signal-to-noise ratio. A simple solution is to keep the exposure time
short and then collect and average multiple frames.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the specific case of imaging techniques relying on diffracted
X-rays (see below), 2-dimensional area detectors are common. These
detectors capture a two-dimensional segment of the full 3D pattern
(also known as the Ewald diffraction sphere). Any crystallites whose
orientation produces diffraction vectors landing within this segment
will be detected. The exact range depends on the geometry of the
experimental setup and the wavelength of radiation used; high energy
X-rays cause more diffraction conditions to be detectable in a given
area. A 1-dimensional pattern can then be obtained by integrating
around the resulting diffraction rings.
}


\DIFaddend \section{Mechanisms of Chemical Contrast}

\subsection{Hyperspectral Imaging}

X-ray microscopy utilizes a multitude of contrast
mechanisms. \emph{Absorption contrast} relies on the intensity of the
X-rays that penetrate through the material being imaged. From the
physical perspective, it involves detecting changes in the amplitude
of the incoming X-ray wave after interacting with the sample\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Most commonly, the changes are detected after transmissionof the X-ray beam through
the sample}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, most
commonly after transmission}\DIFaddend . Thickness and composition of the material
are two major contributing factors to the X-ray absorption. Therefore,
through the collection of one signal, both morphological and chemical
information can be generated. Since X-ray absorbance depends on
interaction with electrons, elements with higher atomic numbers have a
higher absorbance. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The transmitted intensity drops exponentially with
increasing penetration length, so it is more convenient to express
this value as a logarithm of the ratio of incident radiation that is
actually transmitted; the resulting absorbance value scales linearly
with sample thickness provided the material is
homogeneous. Two-dimensional imaging of heterogeneous samples requires
a more sophisticated interpretation since thickness and composition
both affect the absorbance. }\DIFdelend Once the X-ray energy exceeds that needed to
promote a core electron \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in an element present in the sample}\DIFaddend , a sharp
increase in X-ray absorbance is seen, known as an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{edge. At these energies, core electrons are excited
either to the unbound continuum or to higher energy unoccupied states
as allowed by selection rules. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``edge''. }\DIFaddend Therefore,
the specific energy value of the transition is indicative of the
element and its chemical state (eg.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend formal valence state). Each
element can potentially have several absorption edges, depending on
how many core electron orbitals it has. These edges are named based on
the electron energy level they originate from: ``K-edge'' for $n=1$,
``L-edge'' for $n=2$, ``M-edge'' for $n=3$, etc. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A typical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Spectromicroscopy is
conducted at K- and L-edges. In the specific case of a }\DIFaddend K-edge
spectrum\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consists of two regions ,
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, two regions can be distinguished: }\DIFaddend XANES (X-ray absorption
near-edge structure) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine
structure). XANES provides information on oxidation states while EXAFS
provides information on local atomic structure and neighboring
atoms. In practice, collection of EXAFS data imposes data acquisition
requirements that are currently unrealistic in spectromicroscopy.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since the oxidation state of transition metals is
of primary interest in battery materials, K-edge spectra of these
elements are a very common target for this technique. The L-edge
spectrum of an element contains information regarding the molecular
orbitals associated with its atoms, and, as a result, is also of
interest in spectromicroscopy.

\emph{Fluorescence contrast} is similar to X-ray absorption in that it
relies on electron excitation. The fluorescence signal, however\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend comes
from the subsequent light re-emission. For the element of interest,
the X-ray energy can be set just above the absorption edge. If the
incoming X-ray energy is set above the absorption edge for several
elements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of interest }\DIFdelend in a sample, they will all fluoresce at different
energies. Thus, fluorescence imaging can be advantageous over X-ray
absorption for gathering elemental distribution, especially in dilute
samples. If the energy is scanned below and through the edge,
fluorescence detectors can also be used to produce X-ray absorption
spectra, in a manner that is compatible with spectromicroscopy. This
approach was recently demonstrated in battery
materials.\cite{chueh2015}.

for a more traditional experiment\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wen2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend Phase contrast imaging is advantageous
as it is more sensitive than absorption contrast, and can therefore
utilize lower X-ray \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{energies. Therefore,
this technique }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{intensities. For this reason, phase contrast }\DIFaddend is
often used to study materials that do not absorb strongly or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{materials }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that are
}\DIFaddend sensitive to radiation damage\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{caused by high
energy X-rays}\DIFdelend . A drawback for some, phase contrast
imaging heavily relies upon a highly coherent X-ray source, as well as
a sophisticated detector. A full complex refractive index can be
acquired using phase contrast, by collecting data over a range of
energy points. This information will also be dependent on the
electronic structure of the sample\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but, due to its complexity, this
method of spectromicroscopy remains under
development\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{farmand2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

In spectromicroscopy, whether full-field or scanning, the same
field-of-view is imaged repeatedly while the energy of the incident
beam is changed over an absorption edge of the element(s) of
interest. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{change in phase contrast with X-ray energy can also be
measured to produce chemical information\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{takahashi2011}}%DIFAUXCMD
. However,
this approach is still currently under development, partly because
correlation between spectra and chemical information remains to be
fully established. The }\DIFdelend resulting frame-stack provides a full absorbance and/or
phase spectrum at each pixel. These spectra are then processed into a
scientifically meaningful quantity to generate chemical maps of the
field-of-view. In order for pixel-wise spectroscopic conclusions to be
valid, it is critical that the images \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be }\DIFaddend properly aligned with one
another, which is rarely the case with raw \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{datasets.  To correct for these inconsistencies, some form of image
registration is usually necessary. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-sets.  }\DIFaddend The next step
in the analysis involves normalization of the spectra relative to the
background optical depth. As X-ray energy increases, the transmission
of all materials increases as well. Correcting for this effect
improves the reliability of analysis methods that involve decomposing
the spectra into components of known materials\cite{jin2015}.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Conversion of the resulting absorbance spectra to some figure of
scientific merit depends in large part on the question being addressed
by the experiment. A common goal is to map the distribution of certain
elements. This goal can be accomplished by collecting two frames per
element: one above and one below the absorption K-edge. By comparing
these ``edge-jump'' values for the elements in question, their
relative concentrations can be
calculated\cite{shieh2006}. Alternatively, generating spectroscopic
maps involves reshaping the data to give an array of spectra, each one
corresponding to a pixel in the final map. This outcome is
accomplished by ``looking through'' a frame-set along the energy
dimension and flattening along the image dimensions, as illustrated in
figure \ref{figure:meirer2011-2}. In theory, any analysis that is
performed on a bulk spectrum can be done on a single-pixel
spectrum. In practice, there are generally a lot of spectra to be
analyzed; a set of $1024\times1024$ frames contains over 1 million
spectra to be processed. This situation means that analysis cannot
rely on human intervention. If prior knowledge of the presence and
distinct spectra of multiple phases in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-set }\DIFaddend is available,
their signals can be
decomposed\cite{wang2016,yu2015-2,shapiro2014}. If the component
spectra are not known, which is often the case, a variety of signal
processing techniques, such as \emph{independent components analysis}
(ICA)\cite{shlens2014} or \emph{Bayesian} methods\cite{knuth2005}, can
be used to approximate them and extract the relative proportions of
each component\cite{bioucas2012,duarte2014}. Care must be taken,
however, since many of these methods assume properties of the data
that are not necessarily true. \emph{Principal components analysis} is
a common alternative to ICA that has seen application in
spectromicroscopy of battery materials
\cite{shapiro2014,boesenberg2013}. Another approach involves the use
of numerical methods to directly map some property of the
spectrum. This approach is most effective if an argument can be made
that the directly calculated value correlates strongly with some
change in the properties or state of the material. For example, the
oxidation state of nickel in several layered battery cathode materials
is accompanied by a shift in the edge and whiteline positions of the
corresponding K-edge spectrum to higher energies\cite{deb2006};
extracting and mapping the whiteline position for each pixel's
spectrum can provide a map that approximates the oxidation state of
the metal and consequently the state-of-charge of the material. Care
must be taken to account for small variations in absorbance across the
two or three largest absorbance points which are not due to the
sample, but background or spurious signals.


\subsection{Bragg Diffraction Microscopy}

Bragg X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides complementary information to
spectroscopy. Rather than observing electronic transitions, it
provides a measurement of the distance between crystalline planes
(d-space) within a material. This crystallographic information means
that unit cell parameters, atomic defects, strain and microstructural
information of the coherent domains are available. Of particular
interest in the context of this discussion is the ability to interpret
the unit cell dimensions as a given chemical composition if prior
knowledge of the system exists. In order to observe diffraction from a
material, the Bragg condition must be satisfied, in which a particular
X-ray wavelength, crystal spacing, and orientation must be met. A
conventional XRD experiment holds the X-ray wavelength constant, while
altering the incident and detected beam angles. In contrast, energy
dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) holds the orientation constant
and varies the wavelength. As a result, no goniometer is required and
the variation in wavelength can be used to profile the depth of the
sample, but extracting physical quantities from the resulting data is
less straightforward\cite{michel2005,strobridge2015}. Once a
diffraction pattern is obtained, crystallographic parameters can be
extracted and used for mapping. The data generated in Bragg
diffraction microscopy experiments can be treated very similarly to
those collected during spectromicroscopy. Each mapping position is
equivalent to a pixel in an X-ray micrograph and a series of frames
are collected at different scattering vectors, $q$. Generally, the
spatial dimensions are the slowest-changing in diffraction mapping,
whereas they are the fastest (or even simultaneous) in microscopy;
this distinction does not change the structure of the data in a
significant way. However, it does obviate the need to align each
image. Rather than a full absorbance spectrum at each location, these
experiments generate a diffractogram at each position. Theoretically,
a researcher can analyze the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two-diffraction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two-dimensional diffraction }\DIFaddend pattern at
each position; often, the 2D patterns are integrated to form the more
traditional 1D diffractograms. From here, a refinement can retrieve
crystallographic parameters, such as unit-cell dimensions, strain or
phase ratios.

\subsection{The Ultimate Frontier: The Lensless Microscope}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A technique that uses phase contrast imaging in conjunction with Bragg diffraction is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Phase contrast and Bragg diffraction are combined in }\DIFaddend coherent
diffractive imaging (CDI). A single particle fulfilling the Bragg
condition is illuminated by a coherent X-ray beam that is larger than
the particle. The detector is placed far away from the sample, so that
it can collect fringes of the diffracted beam. An iterative algorithm
is used to reconstruct an image from the phase information in the
fringes of a three-dimensional diffraction
pattern\cite{robinson2009}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This methodology decouples spatial
resolution from the characteristics of any focusing optics used. In
other words, as a lensless technique, the process of generation of
images does not suffer from lens aberration and thus allows for very
high spatial resolution approaching the diffraction limit, under
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{10}{nm} }%DIFAUXCMD
in some cases.
}\DIFaddend 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{shapiro2014.png}
  \caption{Schematic of soft X-ray ptychographic microscope. An
    incoming X-ray beam is focused onto the sample by a zone plate and
    order sorting aperture. The coherent diffraction pattern is
    collected by a CCD\cite{shapiro2014}.}
  \label{figure:shapiro2014}
\end{figure}

Ptychography is another lensless technique which also relies on
collecting the full diffraction pattern using coherent
diffraction. Unlike CDI, this is a scanning technique; small spots are
collected in such a fashion that they spatially overlap on the
sample. Similar to CDI, ptychography utilizes an iterative algorithm
to reconstruct an image from the diffraction patterns. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A random object
image is first generated. For each scanning position, a Fourier
transform is performed on the object and is convolved by the
illumination probe. The real component is replaced by the recorded
interference pattern and an inverse Fourier transform is then done to
recover an improved object. This procedure is carried out for each
scanning position and then repeated until a solution converges. }\DIFdelend As a result,
the ultimate spatial resolution is, to a large extent, independent
from the size of the beam used to collect the overlapping
patterns. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In other words, as a lensless technique, the process of
generation of images does not suffer from lens aberration and thus
allows for very high spatial resolution approaching the diffraction
limit, under \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{10}{nm} }%DIFAUXCMD
in some cases. }\DIFdelend Artifacts from the reconstruction process sometimes manifest
as high frequency bands alongside sharp edges in the specimen. Since
this technique is driven by an interference pattern, the best
reconstructions are obtained from strongly scattering
materials. Ptychography has also been performed in tomographic
mode\cite{venkatakrishnan2016}, but this methodological area is still
in its infancy. As an added bonus, the reconstruction produces both
the real and imaginary components of the object image. By comparison
to an area with no material, the fully complex refractive index can be
calculated. Exploiting the complex-valued nature of this technique is
a relatively unexplored area.

\subsection{Visualization and Colormaps}

Turning a large \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-set }\DIFaddend into a two-dimensional image is a task \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that
becomes more challenging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of
increasing difficulty }\DIFaddend as the number of dimensions increases. For
applications with two spatial dimensions, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{map }\DIFdelend images are generated by
data-reduction as described in the preceding sections. The
relationship between values and colors is known as a ``colormap'' or
``lookup table''. The choice of colormap can have subtle effects on
how the data are interpreted. In general, human vision associates the
brightness of a color with the value it represents, regardless of its
hue. Therefore, an effective colormap translates high values to
high-brightness colors and low values to low-brightness
colors. Rainbow colormaps, such as \emph{jet}, do not meet this
criterion and should be avoided for representing sequential data. Jet
contains bands of high and low brightness that are perceived as sharp
gradients in the data that do not actually exist. Perceptually uniform
colormaps, such as \emph{viridis} for Matplotlib and \emph{parula} for
Matlab, are designed to avoid this problem. Additionally, viridis was
tested against color blindness and ensures that data display properly
to people in this category.

Projecting data with three spatial dimensions onto a two-dimensional
canvas can be done with any one of several visualization
tools. Typically, certain features in the data are of interest, such
as internal fractures within particles or the distribution of certain
elements. Successful visualization usually requires additional
analysis steps that identify and highlight these features while making
the surrounding material partially transparent. Avizo (FEI) is a
popular commercial software package specifically designed to work with
tomography data: it contains a number of filters that allow the data
analysis to be performed within one piece of software. An additional
Avizo package can be purchased that allows it to handle \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{datasets }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-sets }\DIFaddend that
do not fit entirely into main memory, which is often the case for
tomography. An alternative is
\href{http://www.paraview.org/}{Paraview} (Kitware Inc. and Los Alamos
National Lab), a general purpose visualization platform that is highly
extensible, allowing python plugins to be run from within the
application. Paraview has the additional benefit of being free and
open source. For quick inspection of tomographic slices, ImageJ
provides the
\href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/volume-viewer.html}{Volume
  Viewer plugin} (included in the \href{http://imagej.net/Fiji}{FIJI
  distribution}), which is more straight-forward to use than either
Avizo or Paraview, but has fewer features.

\section{Ex situ \latin{versus} operando}

To a large extent, electrochemistry is most interesting when away from
equilibrium. As electrochemical devices, batteries are useful during
operation, which is inherently under kinetic control. While the
kinetic states are determined by the thermodynamics of the system,
metastability is more prominent under electrochemical conditions than
in other classical chemical environments, such as high
temperatures. This prominence also implies that the probability of
producing kinetic states that are only weakly metastable is high. In
fact, the problem of self-discharge, common in certain batteries, is
precisely the product of equilibration of a metastable charged
state. As a consequence of the pervasive kinetic control, ex situ
measurements, which rely on harvesting samples from a cell at a
desired chemical state, introduce uncertainty when the goal is to
describe relevant states under working conditions. Nonetheless, if
caution is applied, and due to their simplicity, these measurements
can still provide valuable guidance\cite{yu2015-2}, mainly because
they do not critically suffer from constraints in measurement time
and, thus, can result in the highest data quality. Ultimately,
operando measurements of battery reactions are preferred because of
the growing body of evidence showing that there are many cases where
the state within an operating battery is different from what is
observed once the cell is disassembled\cite{liu2014, lim2016},
especially when high rates are employed. For this reason, researchers
developing novel methods of imaging should have motivation to enter a
path that results in means to operando analysis. At this point, given
certain confusion in the field, it is worth clarifying that we
consider operando measurements to be a small subset of in situ
science. The condition \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sine qua non }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \emph{\DIFadd{sine qua non}} \DIFaddend for an operando experiment
is that the cell is not stopped to collect data unless the goal is
specifically to measure equilibration phenomena.

While operando measurements are preferred and should be pursued, they
can present several challenges of varying degrees of difficulty. The
setup must allow photons to pass through both the sample and apparatus
with very little disturbance to the signal from the apparatus
itself. First and foremost, X-ray absorbing materials have to be
minimized in order to ensure sufficient signal reaches the
detector. Ideally, supporting materials containing heavier elements
should be removed, or made sufficiently thin so as to minimize their
effects. Another challenge is avoiding X-ray induced damage to
supporting materials, such as the polymer binder often used in the
construction of cathodes. Maintaining adequate stack pressure may also
be important, depending on the nature of the
experiment\cite{borkiewicz2015}. Additionally, the possibility of
deleterious effects of X-ray exposure on the behavior of cathode
materials is not completely understood. One possibility is to use very
high energy X-rays, which can penetrate the casing
material\cite{lin2013} and are less damaging. This strategy is valid
for some diffraction experiments, but cannot be applied to
spectroscopic imaging since specific energies at which the X-ray beam
is absorbed are required.

In situations where high-energy X-rays are not possible, a transparent
window is necessary. Beryllium is a typical choice, but its use
introduces stringent handling requirements due to its high toxicity,
especially in the dispersible form that is generated, for instance,
during machining. It also oxidizes relatively easily, making it
unsuitable for high-voltage battery applications. Silicon nitride is
an appealing option since it can be purchased commercially in
prefabricated windows down to tens of nanometers in thickness. At
these thicknesses, it also does not have any noticeable morphological
features, making it suitable for X-ray microscopy techniques. However,
they are very fragile due to their thickness. Polyimide (Kapton) film
has found widespread use in operando diffraction experiments, despite
the fact that it also introduces an amorphous contribution to
diffraction patterns. It has relatively high transmissivity, is easy
to fabricate and is chemically inert. Unfortunately, it cannot ensure
a complete seal and, like many other plastics, it often contains
filler particles which are heavy enough to become visible in a
microscopy experiment, interfering with observations and, thus,
rendering it unsuitable. Amorphous carbon can also be used. A large
advantage here is its electrical conductivity, which eliminates issues
of electrochemical inactivity of the material behind the window. Since
it is made entirely of carbon, it also interacts only very weakly with
X-rays, so it induces minimal signal attenuation. However, it is
difficult to fabricate, and can react under certain conditions, such
as at very high potentials or against lithium metal. The AMPIX
electrochemical cell, developed by Argonne National Laboratory, is an
example of a cell with amorphous carbon windows that fits the
requirements of an operando X-ray experiment. The cell design ensures
good stack pressure as well as electrical conductivity, closely
mirroring coin cell
conditions\cite{borkiewicz2012,borkiewicz2015}. Even more
sophisticated cells are needed when using low energy, soft X-rays,
where the sample volume must be small to avoid excessive absorption of
the signal by the sample. In this case, designs that rely on
microfabrication have recently been demonstrated\cite{lim2016}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ampix.png}
  \caption{Schematic of AMPIX electrochemical cell.\cite{borkiewicz2012} \iucr}
  \label{figure:ampix}
\end{figure}

Operando measurements create the most severe challenges to an imaging
experiment when considering the three scales of resolution above,
namely spatial, chemical and temporal. Many battery reactions span
several hours, but the need to build a reaction pathway means that it
is desirable to collect at least 5 data points during the
reaction. This goal imposes restrictions on the time available to
complete an image containing the desired chemical information, at the
desired level of spatial resolution. Unfortunately, all modes of
chemical contrast require collecting multiple frames for the same
reaction state to reconstruct a map of the species present in the
field view. Using XANES microscopy as an example, chemical resolution
is achieved by collecting frames at a large number of energies, with
the limit being set by the precision of the upstream optics. In the
particular case of scanning techniques, spatial resolution requires
the use of the smallest possible step size to raster the field of
view, meaning that a similar trade-off emerges in that the acquisition
time is directly affected by this parameter. Additionally, increasing
the collection time for each frame will improve the signal-to-noise
ratio and improve the accuracy of the data, again at the expense of
longer acquisition times for a full frame-set. In practice, the most
common choice is to minimize the number of points to obtain some level
of chemical resolution in the individual frame-set, whether scanning
energy (spectroscopy) or a beam-sample-detector angle
(diffraction). This approach strongly relies on prior knowledge of the
chemical species involved during the reaction, so that energies or
angles are chosen at which signals between these species differ the
most. Such prior knowledge is typically acquired through XAS or XRD
measurements of the bulk average, as opposed to spatially resolved
regions. In the case of the spectroscopy of transition metal species,
a change of one unit in the formal oxidation state translates into a
displacement of the signals of a few electron-volts, which renders the
method viable. Challenges arise when the changes between species are
small, for instance, when compounds exist at redox states intermediate
between end members. The strategy also inherently lends itself to
misinterpretation if previously unknown or unexpected states form in
the measurement, especially if they are related to the known, expected
species. The local character of an imaging measurement means that the
limit of detection of minority species increases with respect to a
data set gathered from the bulk average, especially if they
accumulated in specific regions of the image. All in all, it is
important to be aware of the compromises made to avoid over-analyzing
data. Since the field of X-ray imaging is vibrant and constantly
pushing the boundaries in resolution, it is likely that these
limitations will be alleviated with time, creating exciting
opportunities for rich insight into battery operating conditions.

to many other battery problems. Indeed, studies of other battery
systems with these techniques exist in the literature, exploiting the

reactions in the battery materials discussed here, the reader is
referred again to reviews \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{existing in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{available in the peer-reviewed
}\DIFaddend literature\cite{whittingham2014, balogun2016}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Selected applications
are grouped by contrast mechanism. X-ray imaging at one or two
energies close to an absorption edge can be used to elucidate

approaches can provide highly valuable information, chemical imaging
generally provides increased insight.

\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Morphology}}

%DIF > % Intro to general morphology
\DIFaddend Absorption imaging at a single X-ray energy provides a direct look at
the internal morphology of the material. The short acquisition times
and relatively straightforward technical requirements mean that high
temporal resolutions can be achieved. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Tomography is also common . 3D

. The result was a high
frame-rate movie, with no chemical contrast, showing the initial
distortion of electrode layers followed by gas formation and finally
the catastrophic structural failure of the cell.
}

%DIF > % Intro to 3D morphology
\DIFadd{Tomography solves a common problem where interpretation of two

laboratory X-ray microscopes\cite{shearing2014-2}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Despite the lack of

structure, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with implications for modeling }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{generating unique new inputs for continuum models with the

behavior\cite{shearing2014}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Even when no direct chemical information
is obtained, this technique can still illuminate details of the
underlying mechanism of electrochemical reaction. In conversion
reactions, mixtures of relatively heavy metallic particles and
\ce{Li2O} are formed\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{cabana2010-2}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Since the differences in
attenuation coefficients of the different species are quite large,
quantification of changes in contrast in the image can be used to
create pseudo-chemical maps. This approach is relatively fast, since
data collection still occurs at only one X-ray energy. The idea was
first exploited by Ebner et al.\ to study the reduction of tin oxide
to tin with microscale spatial resolution. A core-shell mechanism was
observed, combined with insight into crack initiation and growth. They
also compared particle-level volume changes and their relationship to
the expansion of the electrode as a whole. They found that the
particles expand beyond the tolerance of the supporting matrix, which
has implications for the reversibility of the
reaction\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ebner2013}}%DIFAUXCMD
. A similar approach was applied to nanoscale
imaging of individual tin oxide particles, generating new details on
particle fracturing and pulverization\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2014-2}}%DIFAUXCMD
. This
single-energy approach to acquiring chemical contrast is only valid
for three-dimensional imaging, since, in two-dimensions, the intensity
of a given pixel is heavily influenced by the thickness of the sample
at that point. Another limitation is that the majority of reactions of
interest in batteries involve compounds that do not show significant
differences in attenuation coefficient. In these cases, tomographic
techniques with chemical contrast are needed.

of transition metals after one cycle was seen by X-ray absorption
tomography\cite{yang2014-2}. Specifically, the authors discovered

cycles in a particle of mixed transition metal oxide

%DIF >  Chemical imaging introduction
\DIFadd{Many of the materials used for battery cathode materials do not show
significant changes in absorbance between the various states
encountered during operation, limiting the scope of the morphological
and elemental-distribution techniques. X-ray absorbance spectroscopy
provides a direct measure of the chemical state of individual
elements. Therefore, it can be used to track the oxidation state of
the electrochemically active species. This approach is not limited to
a specific technique: it has proven insightful using hard and soft
X-rays, K and L absorbance edges, full-field and scanning microscopes,
and in two-dimensional and tomographic imaging modes.
}

\DIFaddend Hard X-ray \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{full field }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{full-field }\DIFaddend microscopy has seen rather broad applicability
to questions in battery research. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As an example, it }\DIFaddend has effectively
been demonstrated to locate delithiation domains in olivine-type
\ce{LiFePO4} microcrystals, and subsequent morphological events, such
as fracture\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend were identified\cite{boesenberg2013}. However, the
spatial resolution of a hard TXM, $\sim$\SI{30}{nm}, did not allow for
a specific correlation between chemical domains and fracture
points. To achieve this knowledge, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy
coupled with ptychographic microscopy was required in order to gather
information at the highest spatial resolution possible today. Yu et
al.\ investigated how crystal size impacts the transformation of
\ce{LiFePO4} to \ce{FePO4}\cite{yu2015-2}. Chemical maps were
successfully produced for particles ranging from <\SI{100}{nm} to
several microns in length. The high spatial resolution achieved in
these ptychography measurements, $\sim$\SI{10}{nm}, finally revealed
the correlation between chemical \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stats }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{states }\DIFaddend and physical artifacts, such
as cracks. Indeed, comparison of ptychographic imaging with
conventional scanning spectromicroscopy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{revealed an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{highlights the }\DIFaddend increase in the

extent of improvement\cite{shapiro2014}. The work demonstrated that
reducing the size of \ce{LiFePO4} particles resulted in less extensive
fracturing while the distribution of reaction products was very
similar, which was taken as an indication of the superior
electrochemical performance from \ce{LiFePO4}
nanoparticles\cite{yu2015-2}.

Combining tomography and XANES microscopy generates a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very rich dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rich data-set

of the two. Additionally, they analyzed virtual slices through the
three-dimensional particle to determine how the chemical states were
distributed. They found significant inhomogeneities across the
particle that depended on its size, as well as evidence of fracturing
caused by volume expansion during the reaction. In this case, fracture
was revealed as the enabler of the phase progression into the
particle, which critically relies on microstructural formatting to
reach completion.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Performing X-ray spectromicroscopy }\DIFaddend operando has the ability to provide
insights that are not available with other techniques. The first
demonstration of operando \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{X-ray spectromicroscopy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{measurements }\DIFaddend using a full-field technique
involved the study of the reduction of CuO particles inside a
coin-cell modified with Kapton windows\cite{wang2013}. A distinct
shell of reduced copper metal was seen surrounded \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by }\DIFaddend an unreacted
\ce{CuO} core, along with an intermediate \ce{Cu2O} phase. A further
iteration of this coin-cell design was developed by Yu et al.\ and
used to study \ce{LiMn2O4} spinel crystals. In order to improve
resolution across the board, the emphasis in the design was placed on
minimizing the thickness of absorbing materials, such as aluminum,
and, for instance, it relied on \SI{1}{\micro\meter} thick silicon
nitride windows. The design was applied to the study of the
transformation \ce{Li2Mn2O4} $\rightleftharpoons$ \ce{LiMn2O4}
$\rightleftharpoons$ \ce{Mn2O4}\cite{ohzuku1990}. During the
experiment, the authors found significant local effects in the
oxidation of the particles, wherein oxidized \ce{LiMn2O4} regions
formed and propagated through the crystal. Additionally, a reduced
tetragonal \ce{Li2Mn2O4} phase persisted at potentials well above its
predicted stability, according to the phase diagram, leading to a
non-equilibrium coexistence with highly oxidized phases. These
observations would probably not have been possible under ex situ
conditions, where \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this situation would be
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the chemical states are }\DIFaddend expected to equilibrate. At
higher potentials, several cracks in the crystals were seen that
correlated with preferential oxidation to the fully delithiated
\ce{Mn2O4} phase, as seen in figure \ref{figure:yu2015}. The authors
speculated that these cracks provide additional, fresh interfaces to
facilitate phase transformation\cite{yu2015}.

\section{\DIFadd{Structural Imaging}}

%DIF >  Introduction to structural imaging
\DIFadd{Even though chemical oxidation state is of primary interest in
electrochemical reactions, it is not the only factor affecting
performance: structural changes can have a significant impact on the
kinetics of the underlying transformation. For example, they are
meaningful indications of the presence of misfit strains during
transformation, which can lead to the fracture events detected by
imaging above\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{woodford2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
These strain effects are not captured when measuring oxidation state,
but are well suited to investigation by diffraction-based
techniques. As a result, the applications presented here nicely
complement the absorbance-based chemical imaging presented above.

\ce{LiNi_{0.5}Mn_{1.5}O_4} was studied during charge/discharge and it
was shown that significant gradients exist right before the phase
transformation, shown in figure
\ref{figure:ulvestad2014-2}\cite{ulvestad2014-2}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Lastly}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In a separate
experiment}\DIFaddend , they used strain maps to infer the existence of
crystallographic defects within the crystallite and observed that
these defects move as a function of
charge-state\cite{ulvestad2015}. They were able to characterize the
dislocation by studying the displacement field around
it. Additionally, they quantified strain anisotropy, leading to the
proposal of a hinge-like structure between the unit-cell layers that
moves more freely once sufficient lithium is removed. Based on similar
observations made during discharge, it was shown that an initial
lithium-rich phase expands throughout the particle, rather than
multiple nucleation sites appearing; this result suggests that within
a single particle, the reaction pathway was close to thermodynamic
equilibrium in the conditions employed.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Interpretation of two dimensional imaging data is often confounded by
the fact that the measured intensity at each position is a projection
through the entire specimen. Tomography neatly solves this problem,
and operando tomography will be a key technique in fully understanding
battery material mechanisms. Despite the very long acquisition times
required, some recent publications show the power of this
technique. In conversion reactions, mixtures of relatively heavy
metallic particles and \ce{Li2O} are formed\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{cabana2010-2}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Since
the differences in attenuation coefficients of the different species
is quite large, quantification of changes in contrast in the image can
be used to create pseudo-chemical maps. This approach is relatively
fast since data only needs to be collected over one X-ray energy. This
idea was first exploited by Ebner et al.\ to study the reduction of
tin oxide. A core-shell mechanism was observed as well as detailed
information about crack initiation and growth. They also compared
particle-level volume changes and their relationship to the expansion
of the electrode as a whole. They found that the particles expand
beyond the tolerance of the supporting matrix, which has implications
for the reversibility of the cell\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ebner2013}}%DIFAUXCMD
. A similar approach
to the analysis of individual tin oxide particles during the first two
charge-discharge cycles showed significant fracturing and
pulverization, with an accompanying loss in reversible
capacity\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2014-2}}%DIFAUXCMD
. This approach is only valid for
three-dimensional imaging since in two-dimensions the intensity of a
given pixel is heavily influenced by the thickness of the sample at
that point. The majority of reactions of interest in batteries involve
compounds that do not show significant differences in attenuation
coefficient. In this case, X-ray absorbance tomography is needed. The
only available example highlights the challenge of interpreting
projection images directly. Wang et al.\ collected a 46-point spectrum
across the iron K-edge of a \ce{LiFePO4} cathode particle and
developed a run-out correction system to enable automated
tomography. In order to accommodate the significant overhead in time
required to acquire 2D images at different energy and angle, the
battery was charged extremely slowly (10-100 times slower than would
be realistic). Nonetheless, the insight collected was noteworthy, with
the advent of a clear core-shell structure, as shown in figure
\ref{figure:wang2016}. When considering two-dimensional projections
from only one angle, it appears as though a mixed state existed
between the lithiated and delithiated states. Tomographic
reconstruction reveals that this mixed state is not present anywhere
in the particle and is merely an artifact of the projection
process\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The impact that X-ray imaging and mapping have already had in our
understanding of electrochemical reactions relevant to batteries is
significant. This perspective demonstrates that it is currently
possible to resolve chemical phenomena at the level of individual
particles, at resolutions as low as \SI{10}{nm}, and, in some case,
while the material is subject to working conditions. However, the
wealth of techniques presented here and the incipience of these
approaches lead to the conclusion that researchers are only beginning
to exploit the information that can be collected. We have emphasized
the importance of appropriately defining the goals of the experiment
in terms of chemical, spatial and temporal resolution. The three
cannot currently be attained at the same time in an experiment that is
directly relevant to function, with compromises leading to loss of
chemical information in most cases. It is also important to recognize
and understand the interaction between the beam and the material,
especially when molecules sensitive to radiation, such as the organic
solvents in a battery electrolyte, are present. This understanding is
currently extremely rudimentary, so systematic studies should be
incentivized.

When it comes to operando measurements, further improvements in
measurement protocols and cell design are necessary. Data analysis
``on the fly'' would provide valuable input to the experimenter in
terms of defining the chances of success of the experiment and
creating options for data minimization and experiment
optimization. When it comes to experimental environments, the higher
the resolution desired, the heavier the need for engineering cells
that notably differ from conventional battery setups such as coin or
even prismatic cells. This design often imposes conditions that are
not representative, or where quantitative electroanalysis simultaneous
to the observations is not possible, inducing a critical loss of
information. Further, given the ultimate goal of guiding improvements
in battery performance, it is important that the design of operando
cells takes into account the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{importance of preserving }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{need to preserve }\DIFaddend the fidelity of the
electrochemical responses to those that define function in a device.

As the community increases its awareness of the unique capabilities of
X-ray microscopes, it is expected that their use in battery research
will continue to grow. Since chemical imaging is only possible at a
synchrotron, this growth will contribute to a vibrant and diverse user
community. The fact that synchrotron scientists continue to improve
existing setups and design new modes of imaging will contribute to the
presence of X-ray chemical imaging and mapping in battery research. In
this context, the availability of access to the synchrotron facilities
where the measurements are performed is likely to become an even more
pronounced limiting factor to be tackled by the agencies managing the
facilities. A solution would involve improvements in the flux and
brightness of the X-ray source to decrease measurement times. Indeed,
many facilities are in the process of upgrading their storage rings to
provide X-rays to enable techniques with increased complexity, while
shortening the measurement times for those that are already possible
today. The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) has now
replaced the original NSLS at Brookhaven. Additionally, the Advanced
Photon Source (APS), Advanced Light Source, Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource, and Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source
(United States), as well Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron and European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Europe, and Spring-8 in Japan all
have plans for upgrading in the future, though many of these are still
in very early planning stages. These improvements promise brighter and
more coherent X-rays. The APS-U project also promises X-ray beams that
will be much smaller in the horizontal direction, allowing more of the
beam to be focused on the sample for imaging applications. The
coherence of the X-rays is critical for ptychography and CDI; having
pervasive access to coherent radiation will make these imaging
techniques faster and more efficient than today. Increased brightness
will shorten the time needed to acquire a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-set }\DIFaddend of sufficient
quality for analysis. These developments would bring experiments
without compromises in any of the dimensions of resolution closer to
reality. In other words, it would translate into an increase in the
time resolution of operando experiments without sacrificing spatial or
chemical resolution and will facilitate the next generation of
high-impact experiments. Both operando and three-dimensional analyses
have demonstrated their ability to generate insights that would
otherwise go unnoticed: combining them in a robust and practical way
will likely be at the forefront of battery imaging techniques. These
developments will surely drastically improve the way that we are able
to define relevant reactions, at the level of molecules to
architectures, providing vital inputs for the design of devices that
break current barriers of performance.
